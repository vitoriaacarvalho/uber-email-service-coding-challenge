## 🚀 Description
- A simple but GREAT coding challenge to showcase my skills on clean code and archtecture.
- In this coding challenge provided by UBER, the developer is suppose to build a flexible mailer service. I choose to implement AWS SES but using the abstractions I created I could also add more mailers and this would show how scalable this code is.
